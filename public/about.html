<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>      <p>
  Hello! I am passionate about web development, technology, design, etc.
   I have always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world 
   problems and make life easier. For some time now, I have developed skills 
   in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. And enjoy 
   creating projects that are both functional and visually appealing.

  When I'm not coding, I love to listen to musics. These activities 
  help me stay creative and inspired. I believe in continuous learning and 
  always strive to improve myself, whether it's through online courses,
   reading, or collaborating with others in the tech community.
